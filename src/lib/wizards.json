The noise of the audible glamer at this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an audible glamer spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.\n\nA character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound, emanating from the caster's direction. \n\nNote that this spell can enhance the effectiveness of the phantasmal force spell.\n\nThe material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax.",

Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. \n\nCommon tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs.

Magical properties are not increased by this spell - a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stein would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionally with size. \n\nFor example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.\n\nThe reverse spell, reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by one-foot increments to less than one foot, by one-inch increments to one inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch - the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.\n\nFor example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps).

        "description": "This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, weasels, or even mice. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, however he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any at all come. \n\n\nThe creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically 2 or 3 Int points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard receives the heightened senses of his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die rolls. Normal familiars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.).\n\nThe wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance of up to one mile. Note that empathic responses from the familiar are generally fairly basic - while able to communicate simple thoughts, these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses. Thus a ferret familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train of thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly its communications to its master would be tinged with fear of the \"big ones\" it was spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar's eyes.\n\nIf separated from the caster, the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it gains the wizards saving throws against special attacks. If a special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the saving throw is failed. \n\nIf the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies.\n\nThe power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal. When this is burning well, he adds 1.000 gp worth of incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a dispel magic spell send them away.\n\nDeliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effects on the familiar's relationship with its master. Purposely arranging the death of one's own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.\n\nOn a d20 roll of 1-5 a black Cat is summoned, granting excellent night vision & superior hearing\nOn a d20 roll of 6-7 a Crow is summoned, granting excellent vision\nOn a d20 roll of 8-9 a Hawk is summoned, granting very superior distance vision\nOn a d20 roll of 10-11 a Owl is summoned, granting night vision equal to human daylight vision and superior hearing\nOn a d20 roll of 12-13 a Toad is summoned, granting wide-angle vision\nOn a d20 roll of 14-15 a Weasel is summoned, granting superior hearing & very superior olfactory power\nOn a d20 roll of 16-20 no familiar is available within spell range\n\nThe referee can substitute other small animals suitable to the area.",

All objects of the group must be within spell range and the group as a whole must be visible to the caster. The wizard need not see every individual in the group, merely the general limits of the group's size and area. For example, a wizard on a hill could look down on a forest and estimate the number of trees in all or part of it. He could not get an estimate of the number of goblins within the forest, however, since the group as a whole is concealed from sight.\n\nThe estimate generated is accurate to the largest factor of ten .For example, if Hornung's guess were cast on a group of 439 horsemen, the estimate would be 400. If there were 2,670 horsemen, the spell would estimate 3,000. If there were 37 horsemen, the answer would be 40.

The eight hours immediately preceeding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw.\n\n\nThe chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any roll of 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveal nothing). Only one function of a multi-function item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5-th level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell.\n\nThe item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charges ring of three wishes always appears to be only faintly charged.\n\nAfter casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character).\n\nThe material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100gp value) and an owl feather steeped in wine, with the infusion drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multi-functional item can be learned from a single reading.\n\nAt the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned.",

The caster can see such things as pottery shards reformed into a whole pot, shreds of paper formed into a page, scattered parts as a working machine, or specific trails appearing out of overlapping footprints.\n\n\nAfter casting the spell, the mage studies seemingly random elements-broken bits of glass, shreds of paper, intermingled trails, etc. The items to be studied must be tangible-coded flashing lights, garbled speech, or thoughts of any kind cannot be studied.\nThe wizard must study the random elements for one round, after which the DM secretly makes a saving throw vs. spell for the wizard. If the saving throw is failed, the spell fails. However, if the saving throw is successful, the caster sees in his mind the pattern these objects form. If the items studied are truly random, no information is gained.\n\nAfter the caster has visualized the pattern, he can attempt to reassemble the parts into their original form. This requires another saving throw vs. spell to determine whether the mage remembers sufficient details to accomplish the task. The amount of time required and the quality of restoration vary according to the complexity of the pattern. Reassembling a shredded map may be easy; reassembling a broken clock is significantly more difficult; rebuilding a shattered mosaic is extremely difficult. In any case, the wizard can make only a reasonable copy of the item. He can use this spell to restore works of art, but they will be worth only a small percentage of their original value.\n\nThe material component is a small hand lens through which the caster studies the objects. The lens is not consumed in the casting.",

The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. \n\n\nNote that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Each round after the initial casting, the creature receives another saving throw, without penalty, until it successfully saves and the spell is broken. \n\nIn any event, the spell functions only against creatures with Intelligences of 2 or more, and undead are not affected at all.\n",

There are many interactions, some of which are listed below.\n\nIdentify: The Beacon resonance is treated as a normal property to be discovered. Once discovered this way, it is known forever.\n\nDetect Magic: When cast on an item with a Beacon spell, the signature resonance of the beacon can be learned for the duration of Detect Magic and picked up on at a range of 1 mile per level. For example, an adventuring party comes across some loot. The wizard of the party detects magic and sees that the ring in the pile is not only magical, but it has a beacon on it! Before they can pick it up, the rogue takes the ring and runs away. Fur the duration of Detect Magic, the wizard will be able to pick up on that beacon (provided they are looking in the right direction of course), at a range of up to 1 mile per level. Once the Detect Magic spell wears off, the beacon's signature is lost.\n\nLocate Object: If the signature of a beacon is known, Locate Object will pick up on the beacon at a range of 1 mile per level. For example, Ginger the Enchanter has created a beacon on a necklace she's given to her younger sister.

After several wild mages destroyed themselves by rather spectacular means (or suffered very odd side effects), the chaos shield was created as protection from these surges.\n\n\nThis spell imbues the wild mage with special protection against the effects of wild surges. It protects only against wild surges caused by the caster's own spells, not from the effects of another mage's surges. When a wild surges affects a caster protected by chaos shield, he is allowed a saving throw vs. magic. If the saving throw is successful, the effect of the surge on the caster is negated. If the saving throw is failed, the caster is affected normally by the surge. The spell does not protect against wild surges that might be caused by its own casting.\n\nThe chaos shield protects of a wild surge for other characters who might be in the area of effect. The caster cannot voluntarily cancel the protection once he has learned the nature of a wild surge; the chaos shield protects from both good and harmful effects. Thus, if a wild surge resulted  in a heal spell for all characters within 10 feet of the caster, the protected caster might not benefit, while all others in the radius would be healed.\n\nThe spell remains in effect until it negates a wild surge or the spell duration expires.",

The answer is then returned to the caster as long as the location is on the current plane of existence, and there is a general consensus from the creatures in the area. Landmarks must be stationary and singular. Should a stationary landmark be moved, perhaps the \"Great Tree of Vitality\" has been cut down and moved, the original location of the landmark as it is known to people in the range of the spell is used. Mobile landmarks, like a King's Crown, automatically fail.\n\n\nIn preparation for this spell, an 10' diameter area must be prepared. If an area has already been prepared (such as a dedicated divination room within a wizard's lair), the spell can be cast straight away taking only 4 hours. If such an area must be constructed, the area must be made uniform and neat. A wheel must be carefully inscribed on the outside with radial spikes to the center. This can be etched, painted, or even made with sticks in a pinch, but the preparation and placement must be exact. In optimal conditions, this takes 2 hours (e.g. paint on an empty warehouse floor). In ordinary conditions, this takes 4 hours (e.g. etching on flat stone). In poor conditions, this takes 6 hours (e.g. sticks and leaves in the forest floor). If the caster is in a hurry, they may use half the prep time with a successful intelligence check. If the check is failed, the caster has not prepared the area correctly and the spell flubs. Generally it is best to roll the intelligence as the spell is being cast.\n\nThe actual casting of the spell takes 4 hours, during which time the caster must sit still in the center of the wheel with their eyes closed and their mind in an open state. They cannot carry conversation or interact with objects without flubbing the spell. The magic sweeps the area in an apparently haphazard manner before returning to the caster a direction (if the spell is successful). \n\nExample: Bobo the diviner casts Locate Landmark, with the landmark in question being the secret burial ground of elves. Bobo is in a human dominated region, where nobody knows the answer to this question, so it returns no answer. Bobo then decides to head to a major port where there are many elves, and casts the spell again. The compass in his hand turns to point North West. Bobo doesn't know how far North West it is, so he travels North West for six days before casting the spell again. This time he is in a small elvan port town that allows human visitors. He casts the spell again, and gets a direction of south west. Bobo knows he's overshot the distance, and can change directions, heading south this time.\n\nA very careful wizard with a compass and map might be able to triangulate the location of a landmark, although this can be tricky since the further the target is from the landmark, the more the compass needle wobbles.

Only after the runes/words have been inscribed can the caster finish the preparation by casting this spell into the object, which includes a drop of the caster's blood.\n\nOnce an object has been prepared, it can be recalled from anywhere on the plane by casting this spell and speaking the sounds/words to that particular object.\n\nRestrictions: 1lb/level of the caster. 1 foot/level. Only the marked object can be summoned, not any attached items (a box will be recalled without its contents). Modifications to the object void the enchantment (writing on marked paper, engraving in a box). Items bound in silver or lead, or those enclosed in silver or lead lined rooms are temporarily unreachable.\n\nThe caster can dispel the enchantment by touching the object.

Poisonous monsters or poison-using characters of 4 or less Hit Dice or levels are prevented from making physical contact with the spell recipient, while venomous creatures of 4+1 Hit Dice or poison-using characters of five levels or more suffer  a -2 penalty on their attack rolls against the protected character. Only injected or contact poisons from natural or innate sources (such as compounds made from plants or the venom from a snake) in a position possibly injure the character are protected against; a thief carrying a vial of ingestive poison in his pouch is not counted as a venomous character while a character that is brandishing a poisoned short sword is counted as venomous. The spell recipient can still be poisoned by a spitting attack or a thrown dagger smeared with poison.\n\n\nIf the spell recipient attacks a creature he has been warded against or uses the resistance of the spell's aura to force his antagonist to give ground, the spell ends. Regrettably, reaching out to drink from a poisoned cup dispel the effect, so this spell offers no protection against ingested poisons. The spell function normally if cast upon a poison using creature or character.",

This covers a roughly spherical volume from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source. All within the cloud must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or suffer -2 penalties to all combat rolls and Armor Class.\n\nThe spell uses one fire source within a 20-foot cube, which is immediately extinguished. An extremely large fire used as a source might be only partially extinguished.

After some time, Ferris found it frustrating that his friends were forbidden from his fortress, and thus he created the Reveal Wonderous Walls spell. Handed down to his apprentices, this spell allows a section of Wonderous Walls to be revealed and disabled for 1 round, letting the caster enter at will.\n\n\nTechnically, this spell creates a tiny portal, big enough for only the tip of a finger to pass through, that exits exactly 1 inch behind the spot touched, allowing the caster to activate the wall from behind. Thus when casting this spell, only one very small point may be touched - a caster could not press both hands 5 feet apart with this spell in hopes that either hand may find a wonderous wall segment, but they could touch a single segment with a finger, toe, or tip of nose to deactivate the wall.\n\nThe portal created by this spell is only active for a brief moment, activated by touch, and does not typically have any use outside deactivating Wonderous Walls, although under the right set of circumstances may allow someone to press a button on the reverse side of a wall. (The circumstances for this are so narrow that such a button would have to be carefully crafted and placed with the intent for it to be activated by use of this spell).\n\n",

It is worth keeping in mind, that any character who reaches 0 strength dies.\n\nExample: Lili the Cleric is fighting a giant with her necromancer friend Leoric. Leoric casts Unholy Strength on Lili, who chooses to give up 11 hp, raising her strength from 12 to 18/100. When the spell expires after defeating the giant, Lili looses 11 points of strength, bringing her to 1 strength. The next morning, she has regained 1 lost point of strength and is at 2 str. Three days later, she's at 5 strength. A week later, she's back at her full 12 strength. \n\nNon-willing subjects, including unconscious people, cannot be targeted with the spell, as part of the magic involves an internal agreement to relinquish HP. Similarly, the muscles of the subject are decayed and undead, giving the subject of the spell a stench of death and decay about them. ",

If there is no room to escape, then the webs are only half strength. Creatures with less than 13 Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are stuck until freed by another or until the spell wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective against creatures trapped in webs.\n\nCreatures with Strengths between 13 and 17 can break through 1 foot of webs per round. Creatures with 18 or greater Strength can break through 2 feet of webs per round. If the webs are at half strength, these rates are doubled.

Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster.\n\nIf the spellcaster holds off his attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to his normal ldl0 initiative roll (thus he probably attacks last in the round). Or the spellcaster can try to get his attack in before he blinks (he must announce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are not added if he is trying to attack before he blinks). If so, he attacks according to his initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. \n\nIf his blink roll is lower than his initiative roll, however, he blinks out, then he attacks in whatever direction he's facing (he must go through with his attack, even if he is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).\n",

        "description": "When a wizard casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate magic it comes in contact with, as follows:\n\n\nFirst, it removes spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects.\n\nSecond, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. \n\nThird, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell). \n\nEach effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel).\n\nIf the caster is higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (thus making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, then the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.\n\nA dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature's saving throw against this effect, otherwise it is automatically rendered nonoperational. \n\nAn interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: a nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.\n\nArtifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DMs option.\nNote that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions. Similar to Identify and picking locks, a failure to dispel means that it cannot be dispelled until the caster has gained a level.",

A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down).\n\n\nThe bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (e.g., if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet from the wizard, the far end of bolt would reach 220 feet (180 + 40). \n\nThe lightning bolt may set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to 1/2 foot thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). \n\nSaving throws must be rolled for objects that withstand the full force of a stroke (see the fireball spell). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the bolt continues. A bolt can breach one inch of wood or 1/2 inch of stone per caster level up to a maximum of one foot of wood or 1/2 foot of stone. \n\nThe lightning bolt's area of effect is chosen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt 10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt five feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt cannot reach its full length, because of an unyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt rebounds from the barrier toward its caster, ending only when it reaches its full length.\n\nExample: An 80-foot-long stroke is begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits the wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from the wall, and so is caught in his own lightning bolt!).\n\nThe DM might allow reflecting bolts. When this type of lightning bolt strikes a solid surface, the bolt reflects from the surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence (like light off a mirror). A creature crossed more than once by the bolt must roll a saving throw for every time it is crossed, but it still suffers either full damage (if one saving throw is missed) or half damage (if all saving throws are made).\n\nThe material components of the spell are a bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass rod.",

The caster will need a beacon to lock onto, a high quality and accurate map of the region the beacon is suspected to be in, and a crystal lens worth 50gp that is consumed in the casting.\n\n\nIf the beacon was created by the caster, no unusual preparations are needed; but if the beacon was created by another caster, then she must first cast Locate Beacon on the beacon itself. Preparation similar to that of Identify must be undertaken, clearing and cleaning a space, having silence and stillness, and ridding the room of any other magical items. After the cleansing is done, the Locate Beacon spell can be cast on the enchanted object to understand its resonance, and prepare the caster to seek it out later. Once prepared in this way, the caster need never prepare or attune to the beacon again. An Identify spell cast on the enchanted object will also work to link to the beacon.\n\nWhen a beacon is to be located, a map must be produced and the crystal lens placed on it. The Locate Beacon spell is cast on both the map and the lens (just the one casting) and the caster may then look through the lens at the map to find its location. If the map is detailed and accurate enough, and the beacon is somewhere depicted on the map, it will be seen as a pulsing green light about 1\" in diameter. The beacon is within the area of the light, but not exactly at its center. Two casters locating the same beacon on two different maps, one twice the size of the other and covering the same region, will have two different tolerances. A caster using a desk sized map of the world may only be able to pin the beacon down to a single kingdom. A map of that kingdom might reveal the beacon is in or near a specific city. A map of that city might reveal the beacon is in a neighborhood or perhaps a specific building, depending on specific circumstances.\n\nThe map must be well made, well informed, accurate, and precise. Maps of this quality are often at least 100gp in value. \n\nBeacon and Locate Beacon are often used by powerful merchants and nobles to track larges shipments of money. A single coin may be made a beacon, tossed in with the rest, and if the shipment doesn't get to where it was heading, can be tracked down hopefully before too much is spent or distributed.",

Furthermore, the shell is activated when attacks come within the area of the shell, so it will trigger on missed attacks that roll at least a modified 10, or on attacks that must past through the shell's space, e.g. missile attacks at creatures behind one with magic shell. \n\nWhenever subjected to an attack, the whole shield becomes visible as a spherical grid. The visibility of the shield decreases as its HP decreases. When finally broken, the shield visually fractures and shatters.",

To prepare the door, the caster must fill all the cracks, gaps, and holes in a doorway with some form of animal fat or blubber. When the gaps are filled (to air tight), the caster may finish the spell which causes the components to vanish. A normal door takes ~10 minutes to properly seal with blubber.\n\nThe door will forever have the faint odor of the animal fat it was sealed with. Expensive rendered fat from particular species that produce no smells can be purchased for 100gp / standard door.\n",

Each round, the victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage.\n\nAgainst flesh, the solvent is much less effective; it is caustic and burns painfully, inflicting 1 point of damage per caster level in the first round, but no further damage in the second or third round. However, the burning in the following rounds does inflict a -2 penalty to the victim's attacks while the solvent is active. \n\nThe solvent is extremely likely to cause extensive damage to the victim's armor and equipment; item saving throws vs. acid may apply at the DM's discretion. If the armor or equipment is magical in nature, then the saving throws is made with the usual bonuses allowed to the magical item.\n\nThe great alchemist Vandarien developed his solvent to dissolve iron grates, stone and woodwork traps, and other such hazards.

In this form, the wizard conjures one plane of water, 5 feet square and 1 foot thick, per experience level; for example, a 5th-level caster can create five 5-foot x 5-foot x 1-foot wall sections that would be enough to block an arched passageway 15 feet wide and 10 feet high with a curtain of water 1 foot thick. The curtain's lower edge must rest upon the ground, but need not be anchored on either side, and it remains cohesive and upright for the duration of the spell. Once raised, the wall cannot be moved.\n\nB. Hemisphere. In this manifestation, the wall of water forms a dome 1 foot thick over the caster, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level; a 7th level caster could create a dome with a 10 foot radius. The wall must rest upon the ground. The dome is immobile.\n\nC. Sphere. If cast underwater, the caster may shape the wall of water into a sphere 1 foot thick, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level (no air is in the sphere). The sphere is centered on the caster and moves with him.\n\nIn any form, the wall of water has two primary effects. First of all, missile fire through the wall is next to impossible, suffering a -4 attack penalty for each foot of thickness as well as -1 damage penalty for every two feet of thickness. Creatures gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against attack spells that must pass through the wall. If the spell allows no saving throw, none is granted by the wall of water. Secondly, physical passage through the wall is hindered; any creature trying to pass through must take one full round to do so and becomes soaked to the skin in the process. The wall of water can be defeated or bypassed by a number of spells or effects. At the end of the spell's duration, the water loses its cohesiveness and collapses, which may surprise those sheltering under the hemisphere or standing next to the curtain. Note the water itself may be fresh water (25% chance), salt water (50% chance) or brackish (25% chance), although the sphere will always be composed of the water type that surrounds it. The material component is a vial full of blessed spring water.",

The first creature whose reflection is cast on the surface of the liquid releases the spell. When the spell is triggered, the liquid immediately forms an exact three-dimensional image of the reflected creature. If more than one creature casts a reflection simultaneously, only one watery double forms. Each creature has an equal chance of being the victim of the spell (roll randomly).\n\n\nThe size of the watery double is restricted by the volume of fluid available. If the spell were cast on a full mug of ale, the double would form from the ale, becoming a mug-sized duplicate of the victim. The watery double will never exceed the actual size of the victim regardless of the size of the body of liquid. When the spell is cast on the liquid, its duration is considered permanent until the power is released by a creature's reflection. The liquid will not evaporate until the spell is triggered. When the watery double forms, it remains animated for 1 round per experience level of the caster, to a maximum of 10 rounds.\n\nThe watery double attempts to touch the creature it has duplicated. It can affect only the creature that it resembles. It has the same THACO and current hit points as the creature it duplicates, but cannot cast spells or use any of the creature's magical items or special abilities. The watery double is AC 6 and its movement rate is double that of the victim. It may seep under doors and through cracks.\n\nIf the watery double succeeds in touching the creature, it merges with the individual, covering his entire body in a skin of liquid. The victim must attempt a saving throw. If successful, the creature has resisted the spell's effect and the watery double \"dies,\" becoming normal fluid (and soaking the creature in the process). If the saving throw is failed, the watery double begins forcing its way into the victim's body, inflicting Id8 points of damage per round until it is destroyed.\n\nThe watery double dissipates if reduced to zero hit points or when the spell's duration expires. Striking the watery double while it is wrapped around its victim causes an equal amount of damage to the victim. Part water, lower water, and transmute water to dust spells instantly destroy a watery double.",

A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed. \n\nChances for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and supported.\n\nThe spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half.\nTo activate the spell, the spellcaster needs a miniature shovel and tiny bucket and must continue to hold them while each pit is excavated. These items disappear at the conclusion of the spell.",

The chest will fizzle after 5 minutes unless the Dimensional Chest spell is cast again, in which case the same chest can be sent back without having to move items between chests. A fizzled chest dumps its contents where the chest was resting.\n\nThe chest will say in extra dimensional space until recalled.

This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, and so forth. Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area in which the protected wizard were standing.\n\n\nOne to four (1d4) spell levels may be turned. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows how effective the spell is.\n\nUnlike the 7th level version of this spell, minor spell turning is not capable of partially turning a spell. For example, if a wizard has three levels of spell turning, he can turn three 1st-level spells, one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level spell. He can in no way turn spells of 4th level or above. If the caster is the target of a spell of a higher level than he is capable of turning, the caster receives the full brunt of the spell.\n\nIf the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has the following effects.

        "description": "The polymorph other spell is a powerful magic that completely alters the form and ability, and possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, while a creature with a lower Intelligence can be polymorphed in form into something with a higher Intelligence, it will not gain that creature's mental ability. \n\n\nThe reverse - polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower Intelligence - results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives the change. After this, it must make a special Intelligence check to see if it retains its personality (see following).\n\nThe polymorphed creature acquires the and physical abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, etc.).\n\nHit points and saving throws do not change from the original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters (lycanthropes, doppelgangers, higher level druids, etc.) are affected for but one round, and can then resume their normal form.\nIf slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form (it's still dead, though). (Note that most creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As class and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified.\n\nWhen the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (e.g., -2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.\n\nWhen the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subjects personality and mentality change into that of new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of difference between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels) or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes place.\n\nA subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until recovered by a wish spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form's full range of magical and special abilities.\n\nExample: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 85% (20- 8 Intelligence + 5 levels difference [16-1]=17 out of 20= 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well.\n\nThe wizard can use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions will most likely consider him mad.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon.",

        "description": "A wizard casting the shadow monsters spell uses material from the plane of Shadow to shape semi-real illusions of one or more monsters. The total Hit Dice of the shadow monster or monsters thus created cannot exceed the level of experience of the wizard; thus a 10th-level wizard can create one creature that has 10 Hit Dice, two that have 5 Hit Dice, etc. All shadow monsters created by one spell must be of the same sort.\n\n\nThe actual hit point total for each monster is 20% of the hit point total it would normally have. (To determine this, roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply the hit points by 0.2. Any remainder less than 0.4 is dropped - in the case of monsters with 1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the monster was not successfully created - and scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 hit point.)\nThose viewing the shadow monsters are allowed to disbelieve as per normal illusions, although there is a -2 penalty to the attempt. The shadow monsters perform as the real monsters with respect to Armor Class and attack forms. Those who believe in the shadow monsters suffer real damage from their attacks. Special attack forms such as petrification or level drain do not actually occur, but a subject who believes they are real will react appropriately.\n\nThose who roll successful saving throws see the shadow monsters as transparent images superimposed on vague shadowy forms. These are Armor Class 10 and inflict only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional damage less than 0.4 as done with hit points.\n\nExample: A shadow monster griffon attacks a person who knows it is only quasi-real. The monster strikes with two claw attacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die monster. All three attacks hit, and the normal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by 0.2 separately, rounded up or down, then added together to get total damage. Thus if the attacks score 4, 2, and 11 points, then a total of 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x 0.2 = 0.8 [rounded to 1], 2 x 0.2 = 0.4 [rounded to 1], 11 x 0.2 = 2.2 [rounded to 2].

        "description": "This spell can be cast in one of three ways: as an anchored plane of ice, as a hemisphere, or as a horizontal sheet to fall upon creatures with the effect of an ice storm.\n\n\nA) Ice plane. When this spell is cast, a sheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall is primarily defensive, stopping pursuers and the like. The wall is 1 inch thick per level of experience of the wizard. It covers a 10-foot-square area per level (a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, etc.). \nAny creature breaking through the ice suffers 2 points of damage per inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, while cold using creatures suffer only 1 point of damage per inch when breaking through. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored along one or more sides.\n\nB) Hemisphere. This casting of the spell creates a hemisphere whose maximum radius is equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or melted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents under the hemisphere.\n\nC) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon opponents. The sheet covers a 10-foot-square area per caster level. The sheet has the same effect as an ice storm's hail stones - 3d10 points of damage inflicted to creatures beneath it.\n\nA wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures; its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Magical fires such as fireballs and fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one round, though this creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires or lesser magical ones do not hasten the melting of a wall of ice.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal.",

The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. \n\nA successful dispel cast on the wizard or eye ends the spell.

While retaining the same basic form, the object is divided into two entities, each of half the mass of the original. Both objects are one and the same, only existing in both places, half way, at the same time. What one experiences, so does the other - but that experience is relative only to the object. For example, a tablet with soft clay inlaid could be written on and the text would appear on the other in real time; however; a tablet turned upside down, lifted, thrown, moved, or otherwise translated does not affect the positioning, rotation, or velocity of the other. A sword thusly split could be wielded in battle by two different people without problem.\n\n\nHowever, this split existence is extremely fragile. While each object is the same size as the whole form, it only contains half the mass, an thus has half the strength, durability, and weight. A sword split by this spell would be fragile and of little value in combat. Any blow to the subject must roll its enchanter's level or less on a d20 or the item breaks the spell. Any damage, mutation, or phase change to the item breaks the spell. Blinking, teleporting, plane shifting, crossing extradimensional boundaries, or being effected by any number of spells breaks the spell. Such spells include, but are not limited to: Haste, enlarge, magic mouth, dispel magic, and any successful attack spell.\n\nWhen the spell is broken the object fully materializes in one place and vanishes from the other. If the object realizes in the place where the action that broke the spell exists, the object suffers the normal effects it would there. A clay tablet made duo and struck with a sword has an equal chance of realizing either in the path of the sword, or in its other place - potentially being destroyed in the first case and presumably safe in the second.\n\nAnd Identify or Locate Beacon spell may reveal the location of the other reality when cast on an item split by this spell.

Unlike the lower-level spell, improved blink allows the wizard to choose the exact time of his jump, the exact destination, and the orientation or facing of his choosing. For example, a wizard confronted by an enemy fighter could blink just before the fighter attacked, reappearing directly behind his foe for a back attack. If the wizard blinks away from an attack, his enemy automatically misses - but creatures with multiple attacks may be able to reposition themselves for another swing if the wizard blinks to a location within reach.\n\n\nIf the wizard intends to take any action such as attacking, casting a spell, or using a magical item, he must decide before the round begins if he will do so before or after he blinks. If he acts before he blinks, he may be endangered by an attack before he finishes; he can choose to proceed with his action, hoping that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be hit, or he can abort his action by taking his blink for the round. On the other hand, if the wizard begins his action after his blink, the initiative modifier of his attack or spell is added to the time of his blink to determine when he attacks.\n\nA blinking wizard dueling a fighter decides to blink first, when the fighter attacks and then lightning bolt the offensive fellow. The fighter rolls a modified 6 for initiative, so the wizard waits until 6, then blinks, making the fighter miss. At that time, he starts his lightning bolt, which has a casting time of 3-the spell will go off on 9.\n\nIn the Player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system, the wizard must count 1, 2, or 3 phases from the time of his blink for fast, average, or slow actions. If the fighter above attacked in the average phase, the wizard would blink during the fighter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack, and then his lightning bolt (a fast spell) would go off 1 phase later, with any other slow actions.\n\nBecause the wizard can pick the location he is blinking to, he may not choose to blink into a movable object in order to force it aside - he must blink to an area clear of obstructions or obstacles. If he does attempt to blink into a movable object, he will find himself displaced to a random location (use the blink 1d8 rules in the PHB for determining where he ends up).",

If the roll indicates success, the wizard has located the object or substance and the mirror becomes a magical gate through which the caster can see the target. The size of the gate is determined by the size of the mirror, to a maximum size of 3 feet by 2 feet.\n\nThe gate always appears within arm's length of the target, allowing the wizard to reach through the mirror, grasp the object of his desire, and draw it back through the gate. The wizard must risk his own safety--the gate does not allow the use of probes, long-handled ladles, tongs, or other equipment to gather the material. The caster cannot move completely through the gate.\n\nThe gate vanishes when the spell's duration expires or when the target or the wizard moves more than 10' away from it.\n\nThe gate is visible from both sides, and other creatures can reach through the gate.

Elemental forces (not creatures) will not pass through the gate. Thus, the wizard does not run the risk of flooding his laboratory by opening a gate beneath the sea, for example. However, the spell does not provide any sort of protection against a hostile environment.\n\nThe material components are an exquisite silver mirror of no less than 10,000 gp value and a black opal worth at least 1,000 gp which must be powdered and sprinkled on the mirror.

These responses are conversation (rounds 1-3), possible confusion (rounds 4-6), and then either rage or lamentation (rounds 7-11). All saving throws are affected by the creatures' Intelligences, as noted later. The subject creatures must be able to understand the language in which the spellcaster speaks.\n\n\nUpon casting the spell, the wizard begins discussion of some topic germane to the creature or creatures to be affected. Those making a successful saving throw vs. spell are unaffected. Affected creatures immediately begin to converse with the spellcaster, agreeing or disagreeing, all most politely. As long as the spellcaster chooses, he can maintain the spell by conversing with the subject(s). If the caster is attacked or otherwise distracted, the subject creatures do not notice.\n\nThe wizard can leave at any time after the casting and the subject(s) continue on as if the caster were still present. As long as they are not attacked, the creatures ignore all else going on around them, spending their time talking and arguing to the exclusion of other activities. However, when the caster leaves, each subject completes only the stage of the spell that it is currently in, and then the spell is broken.\n\nIf the caster maintains the spell for more than three rounds, each affected creature can roll another saving throw vs. spell. Those failing to save wander off in confusion for 1d10+2 rounds, staying away from the spellcaster. Those who make this saving throw continue to talk and roll saving throws for each round that the caster continues the spell, up through the sixth round, to avoid the confusion effect.\n\nIf the spell is maintained for more than six rounds, each subject must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell to avoid going into a rage, attacking all other subjects of the spell with intent to kill. This rage lasts for 1d4+1 rounds. Those who successfully save against the rage effect realize that they have been deceived and collapse to the ground, lamenting their foolishness, for 1d4 rounds unless attacked or otherwise disturbed.",

The large chest must be exceptionally well-crafted and expensive, constructed for the caster by master craftsmen. If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, the wizard must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One wizard can have but one pair of these chests at any given time--even wish spells do not allow exceptions! The chests themselves are nonmagical, and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest.\n\n\nWhile touching the chest and holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This causes the large chest to vanish into the Ethereal Plane. The chest can contain 1 cubic foot of material per level of the wizard no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell fails, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magical items, gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has the small duplicate of the magical chest, he can recall the large one from the Ethereal Plane whenever the chest is desired. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can return, although an expedition might be mounted to find it.\n\nWhile the chest is in the Ethereal Plane, there is a cumulative 1% chance per week that some being finds it. This chance is reset to 1% whenever the chest is recalled and the spell recast to return it to the Ethereal Plane. If the chest is found, the DM must work out the encounter and decide how the being reacts to the chest (for example, it might ignore the chest, fully or partially empty it, or even exchange or add to the items present!).\n\nWhenever the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is opened for a variable amount of time (usually about one turn); the window slowly diminishes in size. When this hole opens between the planes, check for an ethereal encounter to see if a monster is drawn through.\n\nIf the large chest is not retrieved before the spell duration lapses, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is lost.",

From there the caster can force an exchange of life forces between the receptacle and another creature, thus enabling the wizard to take over and control the body of another creature, while the life force of the host is confined in the receptacle. The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the wizard's body at the time of spellcasting. The wizard's life force shifts into the receptacle in the round in which the casting is completed, allowing no other actions.\n\n\nWhile in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life force within a 10-footper- level radius (on the same plane); however, the exact creature types and relative physical positions cannot be determined. In a group of life forces, the caster can sense a difference of four or more levels/Hit Dice and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative energy.\n\nFor example, if two 10th-level fighters are attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the caster could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within range, all with positive life energy. The caster could try to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but he has no control over exactly which creature is attacked.\n\nAn attempt to take over a host body requires a full round. It is blocked by a protection from evil spell or similar ward. It is successful only if the subject fails a saving throw vs. spell with a special modifier (see following). The saving throw is modified by subtracting the combined Intelligence and Wisdom scores of the target from those of the wizard\n\n(Intelligence and Hit Dice in nonhuman or nonhumanoid creatures). This modifier is added to (or subtracted from) the die roll. (See book for table).\n\nA negative score indicates that the wizard has a lower total than the target; thus, the host has a saving throw bonus. Failure to take over the host leaves the wizard's life force in the magic jar.\n\nIf successful, the caster's life force occupies the host body and the host's life force is confined in the magic jar receptacle. The caster can call upon rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its real or acquired knowledge (i.e., the wizard does not automatically know the language or spells of the creature). The caster retains his own attack rolls, class knowledge and training, and any adjustments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If the host body is human or humanoid, and the necessary spell components are available, the wizard can even use his memorized spells. The host body retains its own hit points and physical abilities and properties. The DM decides if any additional modifications are necessary; for example, perhaps clumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the caster must become used to the new form. The alignment of the host or receptacle is that of the occupying life force.\n\nThe caster can shift freely from the host to the receptacle if within the 10-foot-per-level range. Each attempt to shift requires one round. The spell ends when the wizard shifts from the jar to his own body.\n\nA successful dispel magic spell cast on the host can drive the caster of the magic jar spell back into the receptacle and prevent him from making any attacks for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of the dispel. The base success chance is 50%, plus or minus 5% per level difference between the casters. A successful dispel magic cast against the receptacle forces the occupant back into his own body. If the wizard who cast the magic jar is forced back into his own body, the spell ends.\n\nIf the host body is slain, the caster returns to the receptacle, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both the host and the caster die.\n\nAny life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain unless recalled by a raise dead, resurrection, or similar spell.\n\nIf the body of the caster is slain, his life force survives if it is in either the receptacle or the host. If the receptacle is destroyed while the caster's life force occupies it, the caster is irrevocably slain.",

Of course, if the eye is being sent into darkness, then it's very possible that it could hit a wall or other similar obstacle and destroy itself.\n\nWhen the wizard creates the eyes, he can specify any set of instruction or orders that he wishes, up to 25 words. Any knowledge the wizard possesses is assumed to be know by the eyes as well, so if the wizard knows what a typical Jakallian merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. Sample commands might be, \"Surround me at a range of 400 yards and return if you spot any dangerous creatures,\" or \"Spread out and search the town for Arweth; follow him for three turns, staying out of sight, and then return.\" Note that in the first command, the eye only returns if it spots a creature that the wizard would regard as dangerous; a seemingly innocuous peasant that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger the eye's return. In any event, if an eye is ever more than one mile distant from the wizard, it instantly ceases to exist. However, the wizard's link with the eye is such that he won't know if eye was destroyed or if just wandered out of range.  \n\nSome command words can be used to abbreviate the direction. For example, \"surround me\" directs the eyes to form an equally-spaced ring at whatever range is indicated, and then move with the wizard. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. \"Spread out\" directs the eyes to move away from the wizard in all directions. Other commands that might be useful include having them form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or have them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of the wizard's directions.\n\nThe material component is a handful of crystal marbles.",

Thus, the vortex usually moves in the general direction desired, but on occasion, it may move to either side or directly toward the caster.\n\nThe vortex cannot pass through objects larger than its area of effect (it could move through a sapling but not an ancient oak tree) and will be redirected by these, rebounding along the general line of movement.

The wall of stone is 0.25 inch thick and up to 20 square feet per level of experience of the wizard casting the spell. Thus, a 12th-level wizard can create a wall of stone 3 inches thick and up to 240 square feet in surface area (a 12-foot-wide and 20-foot-high wall, for example, to completely close a 10-foot x 16-foot passage). The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation (see the wall of iron spell); however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the area of effect by half. Thus, a 20thlevel caster can create a span with a surface area of 200 square feet.

        "description": "The great, powerful, and aged Waltraud created this spell to replace wall sections in her manor with one way windows that also functioned as emergency escape routes. Glass was removed, and the Wall of Wonder (also known as the Waltraud's One Way Window) was cast in it's place. From the inside, this section is mostly transparent and can be walked through. Any object or creature passing through the wall disrupts the wall for 1 round. Casual inspection from the inside shows the form and some visual details of the illusion. From the outside, the wall appears to conforms to the surface details of the surrounding wall, up to and including touch and pressure. The wall will physically resist outside pressure, impact, and forces as if made from the same material surrounding it with a thickness of one inch. Thus a Wall of Wonder will look, feel, and behave as a real wall would to one on the outside, but act as an opening to one on the inside.\n\n\nThis spell must be cast in such a way as to seal or plug a hole in an otherwise functional wall, tunnel, portal, etc. It must connect with real and solid materials on all 4 sides made of the same material. Should a section of wall or material that the spell connects to be destroyed or removed, the spell fizzles. The wall provides no support to things above, below, beside or behind it. For example, the spell could fill a stone doorway, but not a stone doorway with a wooden threshold or baseboard. \n\nMissile fire through the wall from the inside is possible, as is spell casting, but either of these actions will cause the illusion to vanish for 1 round. Should the illusion rematerialize while something is in it's path, it will spend another round inactive.\n\nHorses, dogs, and other simple animals may be confused or spooked by semitransparent nature of the wall (from the inside) and may hesitate to pass through it unless they are carefully coaxed. Like all things, once an animal becomes used to the wall, it may pass through it with only minor hesitation. Training a war horse to charge, or a messenger bird to fly, through Waltraud's Wall of Wonder is difficult.\n\nThe accompanying 2nd level, \"Reveal Wonderous Walls\" spell disrupts Waltraud's Wall of Wonder if cast directly on a segment of the wall. Detect magic cast from the outside will not reveal the wonderous nature of the wall. An Identify spell cast on a wall segment will reveal its nature, but is impractical for finding hidden wall segments as its casting time is so long and its materials so expensive.\n\nTo cast the spell, first the caster outlines a 1 foot square section with both hands while speaking the words, then they blow mithril dust onto that segment of wall before moving onto the next area and repeating the process until the whole wall is done. All segments must be completed in one casting and without interruption. Interruption breaks the casting, fizzling the existing wall sections. The wall may be no smaller than 1 square foot, no larger than 300 square feet. For every 1 hour of casting, the caster must make a constitution check to maintain the exact detail of concentration. Failure indicates the caster has made a small mistake the the spell fails.",

The spell affects a quantity of liquid no larger than the area of effect. If cast onto a larger body, such as an ocean or large lake, the spell affects only the water within the area of effect.\n\n\nAfter casting waveform, the mage can form the water into any desired shape. The spell does not bind the liquid together in any fashion; it is still limited by its fluid properties and gravity. Thus, a mage could not use waveform to create a humanoid creature with arms and legs and direct it to walk across land. He could, however, create a roughly human shape with flowing arms that rises out of the water, crashes forward in a huge splash, then rises and repeats the process. Other possible shapes include gigantic waves, geysers, whirlpools, and troughs.\n\nThe shape takes one round to form, after which it can be maintained by concentration. The shape can be directed to move in any direction at the rate of 90 feet per round. If the waveform moves into or through a body of water, the form loses no intensity. However, if the wave is moved over dry ground, it loses one die of damage for every 10 feet crossed.\n\nIf propelled against a target, the waveform causes ld4 points of damage per level of the caster to creatures in its path. The waveform can be directed against creatures on the surface or underwater. Those struck are allowed a saving throw; success indicates half damage.\n\nIf the victims are in or on a body of water, the shape will sweep them along. Creatures of small size are carried with the form, moving at its speed. Medium and large size creatures are swept along at half the water's speed. Creatures larger than this resist the movement. Those caught in the current can make a Strength check each round to swim free of the current.\n\nBoats and ships are particularly vulnerable to the waveform. If the waveform is twice the size of the vessel or more, the ship must make a seaworthiness check (as described in Table 77 of the DMG). Vessels passing the check suffer damage as described above, reducing seaworthiness ratings for future checks by 2d6 points until repairs are made.\n\nAlternatively, this spell can be cast directly at a single water-based creature--a water weird, water elemental, or other creature from the elemental plane of water. In this case, the spell causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. The effect is instantaneous and the spell ends immediately after the attack is made.\n\nThe material component is a small, carved oar decorated with aquamarines worth at least 500 gp.

After the first strike, the lightning arcs to the next nearest object or creature. Each jump reduces the strength of the lightning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success on this save indicates the creature suffers only half damage from the bolt.\n\nThe chain can strike as many times (including the first object or creature) as the spellcaster has levels, although each creature or object can be struck only once. Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can strike up to 12 times, causing less damage with each strike.

Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession.\n\nThe material components for this spell are burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water. Obviously, this spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions.",

The dimensional blade can slash through matter with as much effort as it takes to wave a stick through the air. Even stone and iron can be carved to pieces with ease. The spell can be cast on almost any hand-held slashing (type S) weapon, as well as a few thrown weapons of this type, such as the chakram, shuriken, or a hand axe.\n\n\nAgainst creatures, the dimensional blade ignores any portion of Armor Class derived from armor itself; only magical and Dexterity adjustments affect the opponent's AC. For example, a warrior in chain mail +2 with a Dexterity of 17 is normally AC 20, but against the dimensional blade he only applies the 3-point adjustment for Dexterity and the 2-point magical adjustment, for a total AC of 15. Creatures wearing purely magical armor (such as bracers of defense) may keep the full magical adjustment. Monsters with thick or toughened hides, such as dragons, may lose part of the Armor Class at the DM's discretion. The weapon gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls in any event, but the wielder ignores any Strength-based combat adjustments-muscle power doesn't help the blade at all.\n\nThe dimensional blade is also quite effective against inanimate objects. Any object with a diameter or thickness smaller than the blades length must make a saving throw vs. disintegration when struck, or be cleanly severed in twain. Larger objects can be sawed through or sliced away at the rate of about 5 cubic feet per round. It's dangerous to attempt to disarm a dimensional blade; the weapon used must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration or be destroyed.\n\nFinally, the blade is also effective against phased or ethereal creatures since part of its existence is forced into the Ethereal Plane. If the wielder has some way to detect creatures concealed in this way, the blade can strike and affect them normally, but without the power to negate Armor Class or other combat bonuses.\n\nThe wizard must touch the weapon to be affected by the spell, but afterward anyone may wield it. The material component for this spell is a razor-thin shard of glass.",

        "description": "This is a spell that must be used by a wizard planning to create a magical item. The enchant an item spell prepares the object to accept the magic. The item must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 100gp. With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted.\n\n\nThe wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process.\n\nThe item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.)\n\nAt the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the 1d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again.\n\nEach spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his\nperson. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours o the last, even if the prior spell failed.\n\nNo magic placed on an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, an item that is charged--a rod, staff, wand, javelin of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.--can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose.\n\nThe materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of kirin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play.  ",

        "description": "Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a powerful creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, where it will be held until it agrees to perform one service in return for freedom from the ensnarement spell. The type of creature to be ensnared must be known and stated, and if it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the ensnarement spell. The spell causes an awareness of a gatelike opening on the plane of the creature to be ensnared. A special saving throw is then made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar opening as a trap or believes it to be a gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. The score is modified by the difference between the creature's Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a higher score, the difference is added to the dice roll.\n\n\nIf the saving throw succeeds, the creature ignores the spell-created opening, and the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the creature steps into the opening and is ensnared.\n\nWhen so trapped, the otherplanar creature can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, unless the caster has created a warding circle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). Even with such protection, the entrapped creature may break free and wreak its vengeance upon the spellcaster.\n\nA hand-drawn circle has a base failure chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved has a base of 10% (and that is for the first time it is used, to determine whether or not the job was done properly). The base chance is modified by the difference between the wizard's combined Intelligence and experience level and the Intelligence and the experience level or Hit Dice of the creature ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher total, that difference in percentage points is subtracted from the chance for the creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that difference is added to its chance to break free.\n\nThe chance can be further reduced by careful preparation of the circle. If the handmade circle is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments (1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent in preparation. This can bring the base chance to 0%.\n\nSimilarly, an inlaid or carved design can be brought to a 0% chance of the creature breaking free by inlaying with various metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the circle inlaid or carved into stone. Any break in the circle spoils the efficacy of the spell and enables the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents it.\n\nOnce safely ensnared, the creature can be kept for as long as the spellcaster dares. (Remember the danger of something breaking the ward!) The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the barrier. The caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature.\n\nThe DM will then assign a value to what the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, rating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most persuasive). This rating is then subtracted from the Intelligence score of the creature. If the creature rolls a successful Intelligence check against its adjusted Intelligence, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature's Intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until the caster decides to get rid of it by means of some riddance spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.\n\nOnce the single service is completed, the creature need only so inform the spellcaster to be instantly sent from whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge.",

This gaze attack is in addition to any other attacks allowed to the wizard. The wizard selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is cast, and this attack cannot be changed. For example, a 12th-level caster who chose fear would have four opportunities to make gaze attacks causing fear, one for each round of the spell's duration. Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows:\n\n\nCharm: The wizard can charm a single person or monster by gaze and by uttering a single word. The effect is to make the charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile to the caster, even to the point of personal danger. It is otherwise the same as a charm monster spell. All creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses.\n\nFear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze and by speaking a single word. The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. After this, the creature refuses to face the caster and cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if subsequently confronted by the caster (50% chance of either). The latter effect lasts one turn per caster level. This attack can be negated by spells that counter fear.\n\nSicken: This power enables the caster to merely gaze, speak, a word, and cause sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject's body. Creatures with ability scores function at half effectiveness; others inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. Movement is at one-half normal rate. The subject remains stricken for one turn per level of the caster, after which all abilities return at the rate of one point per turn of complete rest or one point per hour of moderate activity. The effects cannot be negated by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove curse or successful dispel magic spell is effective. Creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses versus this attack.\n\nSleep: The wizard can cause any individual to fall into a comatose slumber by means of a gaze and a single word, unless the subject successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st-level sleep spell save with -2 penalties. An affected creature must be shaken or otherwise shocked back to consciousness.\n\nIn all cases, the gaze attack has a speed factor of 1. This spell does not affect undead of any type, or extend beyond the plane occupied by the caster. Note that the caster is subject to the effects of his reflected gaze and is allowed any applicable saving throw.

The greater sign has several effects; first of all, it affects a doorway or item that opens (a chest, for instance) as a wizard lock spell. If placed in an open corridor or archway to prevent passage, the greater sign creates a magical barrier that repels all who try to pass.\n\n\nSecond, the greater sign greatly strengthens the physical structure of any door or item it is placed upon, granting a +6 bonus on any item saving throws and allowing the item or door to ignore 1 point of damage per caster level from any attack. For example, a greater sign cast by a 12th-level wizard would reduce the damage of any blow or spell by 12 points, so a fighter armed with a broad sword (maximum damage of 8 points) could never hack through a door protected by the sign.\n\nFinally, if the protected doorway or item is forced open or destroyed by any means, the sign itself is not only destroyed, but also releases a spell upon the offending creature. The spell held by the sign is cast into the ward when the greater sign is created, and any spell the caster has memorized may be used in this way, from a fireball or shocking grasp to a very nasty wish or polymorph. The range of the sign's retributive spell is 10 yards per caster level, so it is possible to destroy the warding from a safe distance.\n\nThe sign is displayed in plain sight, and most wizards will recognize it for what it is. The caster cannot specify particular creatures or conditions for the sign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operation; it functions against any creature that attempts to pass it, although the wizard can freely pass through his own sign without activating it. The greater sign can be removed by the caster, thus ending the spell, or it can be defeated by a limited wish or wish spell cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the original caster; it cannot be dispelled.\n\nThe material component for a greater sign is a powdered diamond worth at least 1,000gp.",

If only detailed information on the person, place, or thing is known, casting time is 1d10 days. If only rumors are known, casting time is 2d6 weeks.\n\n\nDuring the casting, the wizard cannot engage in activities other than the routine: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination reveals if legendary material is available. It often reveals where this material is--by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It sometimes gives certain information regarding the person, place, or thing (when the object of the legend lore is at hand), but this data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). Naturally, a legend lore spell reveals information only if the person, place, or thing is noteworthy or legendary.\n\nFor example, suppose Delsenora came across an extremely well-made sword. It radiates magic, but when she used an identify spell, she could not learn any information. Even giving it to a trusted fighter didn't work, as the sword did not reveal any special powers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, hoping to gain more information. Since the sword is at hand, she completes the spell in three turns. In her mind comes the message, \"Once this was the sword of he who waits till Albion's time of greatest peril, when unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the hand that gave me and fair was the hand that reclaimed me.\" Clearly, Delsenora realizes, this must be a very powerful item, since her spell gave only a cryptic answer. But who is he who waits? And where is Albion? For more information, Delsenora is going to have to cast more spells. But now the process will take much longer, since she has only the vaguest of clues to follow.\n\nThe legend lore spell is cast with incense and strips of ivory formed into a rectangle, but some item of value to the caster must be sacrificed in addition--a potion, magical scroll, magical item, etc.",

The trough remains as long as the spell lasts or until the wizard who cast it opts to end its effects. If cast under water, this spell creates an air cylinder of appropriate length and diameter.

The caster must also have an amount of sand on hand. Once the fire has reached the required intensity, the caster imbues a handful of sand with the magic of the spell and tosses it into the flames where they are quickly and brightly incinerated in an instant, and altering the flames to act as a window into the past. \n\n\nAny who look upon the flames will see the same event or location as if viewed through a window whose shape flickers with the flame. The caster chooses a location and a time when enchanting the first handful of sand, and can change location and time with each subsequent imbued handful they add to the fire.\n\nThe location must be public, something generally accessible to anyone, unless the caster adds to the fire a flammable personal affect of a specific person whose past they wish to view. The item should be relatively whole and personal in nature. Alternatively, a drop of blood or the root of a hair, freshly procured in the last 24 hours, may be used in lieu of a personal item. The location can be changed with a handful of sand. Regardless whether the caster is viewing a public area, or a specific person, a room lined with lead or silver will block the spell and the caster will see nothing but flames.\n\nThe time frame is limited to the past, viewed in real time, and limited to increments of exactly 1 year. Should a caster wish to view the events of the previous day, they would have to wait a year minus a day to see them. The time may be changed with a handful of sand to any increment of 1 year that they wish.\n\nPostcognition can be channeled for as long as the caster is no more than 15 from the flames, their intensity is maintained, and the caster maintains concentration on the spell. They may converse with those around them as long as it is about what is happening in the fires. Other conversation is too distracting and will cause the caster to falter.

The object affected can be no larger than a 10-feet cube, although a section of wall, floor, or ceiling about 10 square feet will work. Once magnetized, the object exerts a powerful attractive or repulsive force(caster's choice) against objects of ferrous metal. The effects vary by the proximity of the metal objects to the center of magnetism, as shown below .See book for table. \n\n\nThe movement rate represent how fast objects are drawn to or repelled from the center of magnetism. If the creature or object in question is heavier than the magnetized item, the magnetized item does the moving instead. The effective strength is the pull of the magnetism at that range; the size equivalent refers to creature sizes, not weapons sizes. A character or creature carrying loose metal items or objects such as weapons, shields, helms, buttons, and so on must win opposed strength check  (see player option: combat& tactics for information on opposed ability checks) in order to keep his possessions from being wrenched out of his grasp by the magnetism. Securing a weapon in its sheath, holding an item with both hands, and other precautions may give the character a +2 to +4 to his base ability score, at the DM's discretion.\n\nCharacters wearing metal armor must attempt an opposed strength check to ignore the effects of the magnetism. If the character fails his strength check outright, he loses his footing and flies towards or away from the object at the full rate indicated. He suffers full falling damage based on the speed with which he hits the item- 1d6 for every 10 feet of the movement rate, or half that ground if the character passes his strength check but is beaten by the magnetism roll, he is moved one foot for each point he lost by. Again, some precautions or assistance may help iron wearing characters in their strength checks. For monsters, compare the creature's size to the effective size of magnetism.\n\nAn armored character who is stuck to a surface or object loses any dexterity adjustments to AC and cannot make any physical attacks. He can try to wriggle out of his armor and free himself, employ a magical item, or use psionic powers if he has any at his disposal.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a small bar magnet, bent into a u-shape and coated with mithril.",

Thus, it is truly a cage, rather than an enclosed space with solid walls. Creatures within the area of effect of the spell are caught and contained unless they are able to pass through the openings--and, of course, all spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars of force of the forcecage.\n\n\nA creature with magic resistance has a single attempt to pass through the walls of the cage. If the resistance check is successful, the creature escapes. If it fails, the creature is caged. Note that a successful check does not destroy the cage, nor does it enable other creatures (save familiars) to flee with the escaping creature. The forcecage is also unlike the solid-walled protective device, cube of force, in that it can be gotten rid of only by means of a dispel magic spell or by the expiration of the spell.\n\nBy means of special preparation at the time of memorization, a forcecage spell can be altered to a forcecube spell. The cube created is 10 feet on a side, and the spell then resembles that of a cube of force in all respects save that of the differences between a cast spell and the magic of a device, including the methods of defeating its power.\n\nAlthough the actual casting of either application of the spell requires no material component, the study required to commit it to memory does demand that the wizard powder a diamond of at least 1,000 gp value, using the diamond dust to trace the outlines of the cage or cube he desires to create via spellcasting at some later time.

Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they behold a magnificent foyer and numerous chambers beyond. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to as many dozens of people as the spellcaster has levels of experience. There is a staff of near-transparent servants, liveried and obedient, to wait upon all who enter. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.\n\n\nSince the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond. Rest and relaxation within the place is normal, but the food is not. It seems excellent and quite filling as long as one is within the place. Once outside, however, its effects disappear immediately, and if those resting have not eaten real food within a reasonable time span, ravenous hunger strikes. Failure to eat normal food immediately results in the onset of fatigue or starvation penalties as decided by the DM.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon. These are utterly destroyed when the spell is cast.(It is worth mentioning that this spell has been used in conjunction with a normal portal, as well as with illusion magic.

        "description": "Related to both the contingency and permanency spells, persistence allows a wizard to cast a spell of 6th level or lower and then hold it until it is needed. There are two general uses for persistence: to use a personal spell effect as needed up to the maximum duration of the persistence itself, or to prepare an instantaneous spell and hold it ready until the caster wishes to use it.\n\n\nA. Personal effect. Any spell that augments the wizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural abilities - detect magic, protection from evil, jump, infravision, fly, wraithform, or other caster-affecting spells-can be made persistent by use of this spell. The wizard casts persistence and then immediately follows with the desired spell. Instead of taking effect immediately, the magic of the persistence holds it ready for use by a simple act of will. The wizard can then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turn on\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd? or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turn off\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd? the girded spell as often as he likes over the course of the duration of the persistence. The duration of the girded spell only runs while the spell is active, so a 15th-level wizard who makes a fly spell persistent will be able to use 1d6+15 turns of flight (the normal duration of fly) over the next 15 days (the duration of the persistence) as he sees fit.\n\nThis is especially useful because it allows the wizard to cast the girded spell and the persistence and have the girded spell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effects available while he then memorizes another spell in place of the spell made persistent. It is also useful because the girded spell can be activated instantly by an act of will. The main difference between this spell and contingency lies in the fact that a persistent spell may be invoked several times (up to the limit of its normal duration) while a contingency functions once only.\n\nB. Held spell. Spells that have an instantaneous effect, such as most attack spells and some movement spells like teleport or dimension door, can be rendered persistent as well. The held spell may be activated or discharged at any time during the duration of the persistence, but its magic is then exhausted as if it had been cast normally. This resembles the effect of a contingency spell, but the effect has no predefined conditions and simply occurs when the caster wills it to.\n\nDamaging or offensive spells that have a duration (for example, flaming sphere or wall of fire) cannot be rendered persistent. A wizard may have no more than one persistence spell active at any given time; if he girds a new spell while an old one is still persistent, the old spell is simply replaced by the new one. The material component is a crystal chalice of exquisite workmanship worth at least 2,000 gp. The material component of a held or girded spell is expended when the spell is made persistent.",

The door does not pass light, sound, or spell effects, nor can the caster see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease.

        "description": "This spell conjures into existence seven magical orbs that float above the caster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head in a ring about 5 feet in diameter. The eyes remain for 1 round per level, or until the caster chooses to either expend the orb by using it in attack or defense. In addition, as long as at least one eye is still in existence, the caster gains 360\u00c2\u00b0 vision and can detect invisibility and detect phase at will, with a 60-foot range. The powers of each eye are described below.\n\n\nEye of the Mind. This orb protects the caster against mental attack, charm, or influence, including charm, beguiling, hold, and emotion effects. The first such attack is negated by the orb and destroys it in turn. If the wizard desires, the eye of the mind can instead be used to charm person like the 1st-level wizard spell, although this also expends the orb.\n\nEye of the Sword. This eye deflects the first physical attack that endangers the caster, including hand-held or missile attacks, and then disappears. The wizard can also employ the eye of the sword to create five magical blades that strike as magic missiles for 1d4+1 points of damage each. (Knockdown d6, medium (1 hit) impact)\n\nEye of the Mage. One manifestation of raw energy, such as lightning, fire, force, cold, or a similar effect, is absorbed by the eye of the mage. The eye can also project a 60-foot long by 5-foot wide lightning bolt that inflicts 4d8 damage (saving throw vs. spell for half damage) to all in its path. Either use expends the eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power. (Knockdown d12, large (1-3 hits) electricity)\n\nEye of Venom. This eye can be used to halt any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. In the case of an attacker armed with an envenomed weapon, the caster may decide to expend either the eye of venom or the eye of swords in order to block the attack. The eye can also be used to poison one creature within 30 feet; the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in one round.\n\nEye of the Spirit. The first attack that affects the victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life energy, including energy drain, strength drain, cause wounds, trap the soul, magic jar, or death is parried by the eye of the spirit. The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power by casting enervation (see the 4th-level wizard spell) upon one target within 30 feet.\n\nEye of Artifice. This eye deflects and is destroyed by the first attack directed at the caster from a magical device. If the attack also takes a form that may be blocked by another eye (for example, the bolt from a wand of lightning) the caster may choose which eye is expended. If used to attack instead, the eye of artifice functions as a dispel magic cast at 8th level.\n\nEye of Stone. This eye offers protection against the first attack that could petrify the caster and then vanishes. It can also be expended to cast hold person.\n\nAlthough any number of eyes can defend the wizard in the course of a single round, only one eye may be used to attack per round. When the caster uses an eye to attack, he may not cast a spell, attack physically, or employ another magical item in the same round; willing the eye to discharge its energies requires his complete concentration. Eye attacks are considered to have an initiative modifier of 1 or a speed of very fast in the Player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system.\n\nThe material component is seven blessed gemstones worth at least 50gp each.",

They may opt to follow the wizard, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Prime Material Plane (50% chance for either result if they are lost or abandoned by the wizard).

While it is in effect, the spell gives no visible sign of its existence. It offers no protection against area effect spells.\n\n\nIf a wild mage is the target of a spell or magical item, this spell automatically allows him a saving throw. If the saving throw is failed, the opponent's spell has normal effects. If the saving throw is successful, the spell shape absorbs the magical energy of the opponent's spell. The wild mage can then choose to let the energy dissipate or he can instantly use it to cast a spell back at the opposing mage. The return spell must be of an equal or lesser spell level than the original one and must be currently memorized by the mage. The act of returning the spell does not cost the wild mage any of his memorized spells. Spell energy cannot be saved; if not used immediately, it dissipates.\n\nFor example, Hamos, a wild mage, is protected by a spell shape and is struck by a finger of death (a 7th-level spell). He succeeds at his saving throw and is now able to cast a spell of 7th level or lower. Hamos currently has feeblemind memorized. Since it is only a 5th-level spell, he chooses to cast it back at his enemy. He makes his level variation check (and doesn't get a wild surge) and the feeblemind is sent hurtling back at his foe. Hamos still has his original feeblemind memorized. The remaining two spell levels are lost, since they were not used in the same round.\n\nIf a wild mage is struck by two spells at once, he may choose which spell to shape. He suffers all effects of the remaining spell.\nThe material component is a diamond worth no less than 2,000 gp. When the spell is cast, the diamond is transformed into a lump of coal.",

This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but specifically excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, etc. Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area within which the protected wizard is standing.\n\n\nFrom seven to ten spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows for certain how effective the spell is.\n\nA spell may be only partially turned--divide the number of remaining levels that can be turned by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect is turned, with the remainder affecting the caster. For example, an incoming fireball is centered on a wizard with one level of spell turning left. This means that 2/3 of the fireball affects the protected wizard, 1/3 affects the caster, and each is the center of a fireball effect. If the rolled damage is 40 points, the protected wizard receives 27 points of damage and the caster suffers 13. Both (and any creatures in the respective areas) can roll saving throws vs. spell for half damage. A partially turned hold or paralysis spell will act as a slow spell on those who are 50% or more affected.\n\nIf the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has the following effects: See book for table.\n\nThe material component for the spell is a small silver mirror",

The caster has a base 50% chance to discern the existence and identity of a particular spell or property, +2% per level to a maximum of 99%. The only enchantments that remain inscrutable to analyze are those surrounding artifacts or relics.\n\n  A 16th level wizard finds an unknown wand and decides to use analyze dweomer to study it. The DM knows that it's a wind of fire, and he decides that the spells enchant an item, fireball,burning hands, and wall of fire were used to create the wand, in that order.In the first round,the wizard has an 82% chance to discover fireball;in the next round, an 82% chance to perceive burning hands; and so on, for all remaining enchantment.Note that the DM could have decided that any rare or unusual materials or process used to create the wand would also be revealed as if they were spells.\n  After the wizard analyzes one object or creature, the spell ends, even if its duration has not expired yet. Casting this spell is physically taxing;the wizard must pass a system shock check or be exhausted and unable to do anything but rest for the next 1d8 hours. While this spell is most frequently used in the comfort and safety of the wizard's laboratory, a mage could also cast analyze dweomer to study the magical seals and barriers on a portal, to determine just how a companion has been cursed, or to examine a potential opponent for defensive spells.\n  The material component for this spell is a tiny lens of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop.The gemstone must be worth at least 1000 gp.",

The wizard must decide which effect is desired with regard to what creature type or alignment before beginning the spellcasting, for the components of each application differ.

If a saving throw vs. spell is successful, the creature can stay in the area or touch the item, but the creature will feel very uncomfortable, and a persistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss of 1\npoint of Dexterity per round (for the spell's duration), subject to a maximum loss of 4 points and a minimum Dexterity of 3.

The desire to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. Unless a saving throw vs. spell is successfully rolled, the creature or character will stay or refuse to release the object.

        "description": "  A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature, usually from another plane of existence. Extraplanar creatures must be confined by a circular diagram; other creatures can be physically confined. The duration of the spell depends upon the form of the binding and the level of the caster(s), as well as the length of time the spell is actually\n\nuttered. The components vary according to the form of the spell, but they include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or book page giving the spell; gestures appropriate to the form of binding; and materials such as miniature chains of special metal (silver for lycanthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest sort, a corundum or diamond gem of great size (1,000 gp value per Hit Die of the subject creature), and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.\n  Magic resistance applies unless the subject's true name is used. A saving throw is not applicable as long as the experience level of the caster is at least twice as great as the Hit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can be augmented by one-third of the levels of each assisting wizard of 9th level or higher, and by one level for each assistant of 4th through 8th level. No more than six other wizards can assist with this spell. If the caster's level is less than twice the Hit Dice of the subject, the subject gains a saving throw vs. spell, modified by the form of binding being attempted. The various forms of binding are:\n  Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except the caster. Duration is as long as one year per level of the caster(s). The subject of this form of binding (as well as in the slumber and bound slumber versions) remains within the restraining barrier.\n  Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon the subject for a duration of up to one year per level of the caster(s).\n  Bound Slumber: A combination of chaining and slumber that lasts for up to one month per level of the caster(s).\n  Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means until freed. The spell remains until the magical hedge is somehow broken.\n  Metamorphosis: Causes the subject to change to some noncorporeal form, save for its head or face. The binding is permanent until some prescribed act frees the subject.\n Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunken to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within the hedged prison of some gem or similar object. The subject of a minimus containment, metamorphosis, or hedged prison radiates a very faint aura of magic. \n  The subject of the chaining form of the spell receives a saving throw with no modifications. However, slumber allows the subject a +1 bonus, bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged prison a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 bonus, and minimus containment a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the subject is magically weakened, the DM can assign a -1, -2, or even -4 penalty to the saving throw. A successful saving throw enables the subject to burst its bonds and do as it pleases.\n  A binding spell can be renewed in the case of the first three forms of the spell, for the subject does not have the opportunity to break the bonds. (If anything has caused a weakening of a chaining or slumber version, such as attempts to contact the subject or magically touch it, a normal saving throw applies to the renewal of the spell.) Otherwise, after one year, and each year thereafter, the subject gains a normal saving throw vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the binding spell is broken and the creature is free.",

All buildings, people, and wildlife within the area of effect are also transported. The land forms a pocket of the Prime Material plane within the elemental plane. The pocket is a sphere with a diameter equal to the diameter of the land. The surface of the pocket allows creatures to enter or exit the pocket, but prevents the elements from entering the pocket.\n\n  Inside the pocket, the land is surrounded by air of a temperature matching that of the Prime Material plane at the moment the land was moved. In addition, a source of water is created within the pocket.\n  Before the spell is cast, the area to be moved must be surrounded by solid markers of material from the destination plane.Thus,if a wizard wants to move his castle to the Elemental plane of Fire,he must first surround the area with solid blocks of matter from the elemental plane of Fire; such as hardened magma or magically crystallized fire.The blocks must be spaced no more than five feet apart and may be placed above ground or under surface(at a depth of no more than three fee).\n  The wizard must be within the area to be moved when he casts the spell. When the land moves, a hemispherical crater is left behind in the Prime Material plane. Inside its pocket on the desired plane, the land continues its existence as if\nnothing changed, with the exception of occasional visits from planar creatures.\n  Any land that is moved in this manner can never again be moved with this spell.\n  The material component (in addition to the markers) is the appropriate magical device to control elementals of the desired plane (bowl commanding water elementals, brazier commanding fire elementals, censer controlling air elementals, or stone controlling earth elementals). The item must be permanently placed at the heart of the area of effect and cannot be used for any other purpose. If the device is disturbed in any way, the spell immediately fails, allowing the energies of the elemental plane to flood into the protected area.",

Slashing weapons,falling, crushing, and constriction attacks of all type are completely unable to harm the caster,although an attack may knock him off-balance or pin him beneath tons of debris. Spells or attacks that affect the subject's physiology or respiration-for example, poison, cloud kill, enfeeblement, contagion or vain touch-fail completely, since the caster has no physiology or respiration while the spell is in effect. Also, spells that have weight limits should be applied to the wizard as if he weighed over 3000 pounds. The wizard ignores electrical attacks and saves at +4 against fire attacks. If he saves, he takes quarter damage;if not, he takes half damage. If hit with a rod of smiting, he takes 2d8+6 points of damage unless the attacker rolls a natural 20.If this occurs, then the damage is doubled.\n\n  In addition to the natural immunities of an iron body, the wizard enjoys powerful offensive abilities. His strength score is raised to 20 for the duration of the spell, and he can punch or bludgeon his enemies twice per round for 1d4 points of damage per blow, plus his strength bonus. Unfortunately,his movement becomes slow and awkward, so he is reduced to a move of 3 and suffers a -2 penalty to his initiative rolls.Most importantly, the wizard's clumsiness and lack of breath prevent him from casting any spells while the iron body is in effect.\n  Iron body may create additional hazards for the wizard as the DM deems appropriate. For example,rust monsters are extremely dangerous to a wizard using this spell.Heat metal spells inflict double damage to the caster, And, naturally, the wizard sinks like a stone in water-although he could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean-at least until the spell expired.Some magical items, such as potions or winded instruments, may be temporarily unusable as well.\n  The material component for this spell is a small piece of iron that once belonged to an iron golem.\n  ",

When used as a polymorph other or stone to flesh spell, simply treat the spell as a more powerful version, with saving throws made with -4 penalties to the die roll. When it is cast in order to change other objects, the duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state, as well as how different it is in size. The DM determines the changes by using the following guidelines:See book for table.\n\n  A change in kingdom makes the spell work for hours (if removed by one kingdom) or turns (if removed by two). Other changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change with a duration measured in hours. Turning a tusk into an elephant would be\npermanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change with a duration of several turns.\n  All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note that a stone to flesh spell or its reverse will affect objects under this spell. As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed\ncreature.\n  For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed; perhaps the wizard could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the\nnew form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate many of these situations.\n  The system shock roll must be applied to living creatures, as must the restrictions noted regarding the polymorph other and stone to flesh spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item's or creature's powers, but does not add new powers, except possibly movement capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a vorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability. Likewise, valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable items.\n  The material components of this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke.",

He could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that his troops be undetected, or even that every fifth man or unit should be visible. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.\n\n  Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by the caster with no saving throw allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. A band of men standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, etc. Direct observation may allow a saving throw (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen.

When casting the spell, the wizard must chant the spell for the remainder of the round without interruption. At that juncture, the subject creature or object becomes rooted to the spot unless a saving throw vs. spell (for a creature) or disintegration (for an object with magical properties) is successful. (Note: \"magical properties\" include those of magical items as listed in the Dungeon Master Guide, those of items enchanted or otherwise of magical origin, and those of items with protection type spells or with permanent magical properties or similar spells upon them.) Items of a nonmagical nature are not entitled to a saving throw. If a subject fails its saving throw, it becomes of slightly greater density than the surface upon which it stands.\n\n  The spellcaster now has the option of ceasing his spell and leaving the subject as it is, in which case the spell expires in four turns, and the subject returns to normal. If the caster proceeds with the spell (into the next round), the subject begins to sink slowly into the ground. Before any actions are taken in the new round, the subject sinks one-quarter of its height; after the first group acts, another quarter; after the second group acts, another; and at the end of the round, the victim is totally sunken into the ground.\n  This entombment places a creature or object in a state of suspended animation. The cessation of time means that the subject does not grow older. Bodily and other functions virtually cease, but the subject is otherwise unharmed. The subject exists in undamaged form in the surface into which it was sunk, its upper point as far beneath the surface as\nthe subject has height--a 6-foot-tall victim will be 6 feet beneath the surface, while a 60- foot-tall subject will have its uppermost point 60 feet below ground level. If the ground around the subject is somehow removed, the spell is broken and the subject returns to normal, but it does not rise up. Spells such as dig, transmute rock to mud, and freedom (the reverse of the 9th-level spell imprisonment) will not harm the sunken creature or object and will often be helpful in recovering it. If a detect magic spell is cast over an area upon which a sink spell was used, it reveals a faint magical aura of undefinable nature, even if the subject is beyond detection range. If the subject is within range of the detection, the spell's schools can be discovered (alteration and enchantment).",

Upon casting the spell, the wizard inscribes the symbol upon whatever surface he desires. Likewise, the spellcaster is able to place the symbol of his choice, using any one of the following:\n\n\nDeath One or more creatures, whose total hit points do not exceed 80, are slain. Discord All creatures are affected   and  immediately fall to loud bickering and arguing; there is a 50% probability that creatures of different alignments attack each other. The bickering lasts for 5d4 rounds, the fighting for 2d4 rounds.\n\nFear This symbol creates an extra-strong fear spell, causing all creatures to save vs. spell with -4 penalties to the  die roll, or panic and flee as if attacked by a fear spell.\n\nHopelessness All creatures are affected and must turn back in dejection unless they save vs. spell. Affected creatures submit to the demands of any opponent--for example, surrender, get out, etc. The hopelessness lasts for 3d4 turns; during this period it is 25% probable that affected creatures take no action during any round, and 25% likely that those taking action turn back or retire from battle, as applicable.\n\nInsanity One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 120 become insane and remain so, acting as if a confusion spell had been placed upon them, until a heal, restoration, or wish spell is used to remove the\nmadness. \n\nPain All creatures are afflicted with wracking pains shooting through their bodies, causing a -2 penalty to Dexterity and a -4 penalty to attack rolls for 2d10 turns.\n\nSleep All creatures under 8+1 Hit Dice immediately fall into a catatonic slumber and cannot be awakened for 1d12+4 turns\n\nStunning One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 160 are stunned and reeling for 3d4 rounds, dropping anything they are holding. The type of symbol cannot be recognized without being read and thus activating its\neffects.\n\nThe material components of this spell are powdered black opal and diamond dust,worth not less than 5,000 gp each.",

The creature must be seen by the caster when the final word is uttered.\n\n  The spell can be triggered in one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the creature's real name is spoken as well, any magic resistance is ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of -2. If the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters.\n  The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item when the gem is enchanted. A sympathy spell can also be\nplaced on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magic resistance or saving throw.\n   The gem prison will hold the trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.\n   Before the actual casting of the trap the soul spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (Note that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the prison gem requires an enchant an item spell and the placement of a maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison to contain the life force.",

Only magical items can be brought into the Astral Plane (although nonmagical items could be rendered temporarily magical through the use of some spells, if the DM allows).\n\nAs the Astral Plane touches upon the first levels of all of the Outer Planes, the wizard can travel astrally to any of the Outer Planes at will. The caster then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body in the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the astral spell, but a second body cannot be formed in the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures in the Astral Plane.\n   At all times, the astral body is connected to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially; however, normally only a psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed in a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the original body where it rests in the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation.\n   Although astrally projected persons are able to function in the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing in the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the wizard desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (such as a dispel magic spell or the destruction of the wizard's body in the Prime Material Plane).\n   The wizard can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with him by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the wizard. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the wizard and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast, according to the wizard's desire. The ultimate\ndestination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the wizard. (See the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set for further information on the Astral Plane.)\n  Any magical items can go into the Astral Plane, but most become temporarily nonmagical therein, or in any planes removed from the Prime Material Plane. Armor and weapons of +3 or better might function in other planes, at the DM's option. Artifacts and relics function anywhere. Items drawing their power from a given plane are more powerful in that plane (for example, a ring of fire resistance in the Elemental Plane of Fire or a sword of life stealing in the Negative Energy plane).",

In doing so, any other scrying attempts end and cannot be restarted unless the caster's name is spoken again.\n\n\nTo cast this spell, the diviner must find a comfortable position, usually seated on a cushion but not necessarily, center her mind, and clear her thoughts, in a process that takes 1 turn. Hereafter she begins to hear her name spoken by those in range, and get glimpses of those speaking her name. If the caster is the subject of much gossip in a large city, she may be bombarded by faces, locations, and her name. At any point, the caster may mute her attunement to those speaking her name. This is useful when scrying upon a subject and wishing to be uninterrupted, or when carrying a conversation without wanting to break the concentration on the spell.\n\nThe range of the spell is limited to the current plane of existence, and grows from nothing at a rate of 60mph (1 mile a minute), centered on the caster. As long as the caster maintains concentration, the area of effect will continue to grow. If the caster wishes to limit the area they are listening to, they may listen to specific bands no smaller than 1 mile in width. \n\nExample: Quinti sits atop her tower in the center of the city which she rules and casts Listen. After a turn of casting, she begins to hear the people in her city that are speaking about her. The city is large, and she is its ruler, so her name is said every few minutes. Quinti looks in on a conversation at a tavern where tales of her exploits are told, she spies the wife of one of her guardsmen arguing about how much time he spends at work and lamenting his close relationship with Quinti, and she views a woman in the dungeons praying to Velthara (goddess of Vengeance) to rend Quinti head to toe. After an hour of this, the range of the spell has extended to cover nearby towns, so she changes the area of effect to a band 1 mile wide, centered 25 miles out. Now Quinti can hear her name being spoken by anyone between 24.5 and 25.5 miles from her. Quniti does this because there is a town 25 miles to the east that rebels have been recruiting from and she is hoping to catch them in conversation, but instead hears her name said by a dying dwarf, in dwarven, 25 miles under the city.\n\nThe caster must remain motionless to continue concentration, which requires Constitution checks every so often, with cumulative -1 penalties after the first. A caster who is seated comfortably makes checks every 8 hours, seated normally makes checks every 4 hours, and standing make checks every hour. Environmental effects may shift these times. Seated comfortably in freezing temperatures might require checks every 2 hours. Outside events may force additional checks. \n\nFor example, Quinti is traveling on the road and stops at an inn for the night. She has a messenger who is supposed to call out to her and relay a message an hour after sundown, so she retreats to her room at sundown and casts Listen. 10 minutes into the spell, the innkeeper comes into her room to change the sheets, see's what's going on, and leaves the sheets on the foot of the bed Quinti is casting from, and exits the room. The DM rules this is enough of a disturbing event that it might break her concentration, so she calls for a con check, which Quinti passes. She continues to wait for her messenger who doesn't speak up in the first 8 hours. Concerned, she decides to continue channeling and listening to the range she expects, but now must make a con check. Since she has already made 1 check, she must now make this second one at -1. When the innkeeper comes in to bring her breakfast at sun up, she is forced to make a check at -2, which she fails. Quinti's 9th level spell was interrupted by a too-eager innkeeper who must now face her wrath.",

Each has a 30-foot diameter area of effect, and each sphere is 20 feet apart along the sides of the pattern, creating overlapping areas of effect and exposing the center to all four blasts.\n  The smaller spheres (1-foot diameter) each have a 15-foot diameter area of effect, and each inflicts 5d4 points of damage. They burst in a pattern of a box within a diamond or vice versa, with each of the outer sides 20 feet long. Note that the center has four areas of overlapping effect, and there are numerous peripheral areas that have two overlapping areas of effect.

Thus, he can change into a griffon and fly away, then to an efreet and fly through a roaring flame, then to a titan to lift up a wagon, etc. These creatures have whatever hit points the wizard had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.\n\nFor example, a wizard is in combat and assumes the form of a will o' wisp. When this form is no longer useful, the wizard changes into a stone golem and walks away. When pursued, the golem-shape is changed to that of a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off and become a bush. If detected as the latter, the wizard can become a dragon, an ant, or just about anything he is familiar with.\nA wizard adopting another form also adopts its vulnerabilities. For example, a wizard who becomes a spectre is powerless in daylight, and is subject to being turned, controlled, or destroyed by opposing clerics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is killed in another form does not revert to his original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification.\nThe material component is a jade circlet worth no less than 5,000 gp, which shatters at the end of the spell's duration.

Even if they are subjected to these spells, a saving throw is allowed (equal to the creator",

        "description": " This spell is similar in effect to wildstrike and wildzone. When cast, a wall of faint, multicolored lights springs into existence at the point indicated by the caster. These lights form a line 150 feet long. After the first round of the spell, the wizard can move the wall of lights. Each round, the caster can move the wall in the same direction or as much as 45 degrees to either side.Once the wall is set in motion, it cannot be stopped unless the spell is cancelled or dispelled.The lights can move 60 feet per round.\n\n  The wildwind has two significant effects. First,all creatures struck by the magical lights suffer 2d6 points of damage. Second, any spellcaster struck while attempting to cast a spell automatically triggers a wild surge (use Table 2). Magical items that expend charges that touch the wall of lights automatically release one charge, also resulting in a wild surge.",

        "description": " The wish spell is a more potent version of a limited wish. If it is used to alter reality with respect to damage sustained by a party, to bring a dead creature to life, or to escape from a difficult situation by lifting the spellcaster (and his party) from one place to another, it will not cause the wizard any disability. Other forms of wishes, however, cause the spellcaster to weaken (-3 on Strength) and require 2d4 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time, space, and his body. Regardless of what is wished for, the exact terminology of the wish spell is likely to be carried out. Casting a wish spell ages the caster five years.\nDiscretionary power of the DM is necessary in order to maintain game balance. For example, wishing another creature dead is grossly unfair; the DM might well advance the spellcaster to a future period in which the creature is no longer alive, effectively putting the wishing character out of the campaign.",
