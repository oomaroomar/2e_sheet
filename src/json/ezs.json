        "description": "This spell enables the wizard to cause nonmagical fires - from as small as a torch or lantern to as large as the area of effect - to reduce in size and brightness to become mere coals or increase in light to become as bright as full daylight and increase the illumination to double the normal radius. Note that this does not affect either fuel consumption or damage caused by the fire. \n\nThe caster can affect any or all fires in the spell's area. He can alter their intensities with a single gesture as long as the spell is in effect. \n\nThe spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all fuel is burned, or the duration expires. The caster can also extinguish all flames in the area, which expends the spell immediately. The spell does not affect fire elementals or similar creatures.",
